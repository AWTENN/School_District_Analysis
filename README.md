# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing test data from a School District using Python.
## Challenge Overview
- This Analysis was to show multiple different categories of how 14 schools in this district compared to each other by the percentage of students passing with the criteria being: Number of students, Budget per student, and Type of School. This was altered because of some academic dishonesty with the 9th grade class of Thomas High School
## Challenge Summary

- For the new District Summary, The percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall passing decreased slightly with 0.2, 0.3, and 0.1 percentage points respectively.

- For the new Per School Summary, replacing the 9th grade student’s grades with NA’s lowered Thomas High School’s grade considerably from all in the 90s to all in the 60s.

- Replacing the data after only taking the grades with actual scores(10th-12th), the scores increase drastically in the coding from the 60s to the 90s again. But before changing the 9th grade scores to NA’s the scores were very similar to the new scores of 10th to 12th grade.

- The Math and Reading Scores by grade are affected only by the 9th grade score being an NA instead of an actual score.

- The Scores by school spending was also not affected majorly by the change of the 9th grade scores being replaced, for the score still rounded up to 63 once the data frame was formatted. Thomas High School is in the $630 to $644 spending zone.

- The school size data seems to also have been unaffected by the change as the medium range of students (1000 – 2000) had the same grades and passing scores in both documents.

- As for the other data frames, Scores by School Type also did not change much, if at all. 

## Challenge Summary
- I apologize but I am not seeing many differences after the change to the data. It seems that the data frames were the same after the change to the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School were changed to NA.
